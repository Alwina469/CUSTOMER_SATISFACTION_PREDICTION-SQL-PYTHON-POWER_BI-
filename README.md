# CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PREDICTION : DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

In today’s competitive market, businesses must ensure high-quality customer support to retain customers and enhance brand reputation. 

This project, "Customer Satisfaction Prediction," leverages **MySQL, Jupyter Notebook, and Power BI** to analyze 8000+ customer support tickets, predict customer satisfaction, and optimize ticket resolution.

By applying **data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling** , we developed key insights to enhance customer experience, agent efficiency, and service performance.

## STEPS FOLLOWED

### Data Cleaning (SQL)

- Removed duplicates and unnecessary columns to maintain dataset integrity.

- Standardized data formats (date, text, categorical variables).

- Identified and handled null values effectively.


### Feature Engineering (SQL)

- Added 3 new columns to improve predictive analysis.



### Model Building (SQL)(BASIC)

- **Customer Satisfaction Prediction Model**– Forecasts satisfaction scores based on ticket details.

- **Recommendation System** – Suggests relevant solutions/products to reduce ticket volume.

- **Ticket Resolution Time Prediction Model** – Estimates the time required to resolve customer issues.

- **Automated Sentiment Analysis** – Analyzes customer feedback and classifies sentiments as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Jupyter Notebook + SQL)

- Analyzed ticket distribution by type, priority, channel, and customer demographics.

- Evaluated average resolution time, first response efficiency, and customer sentiment.

- Identified top customers, most common issues, and busiest support days.


### Power BI Dashboard Development

- Designed an interactive 4-page dashboard showcasing KPIs, trends, and insights.

- Included slicers, filters, and DAX calculations for dynamic exploration.
